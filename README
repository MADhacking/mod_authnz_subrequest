mod_authnz_subrequest - Apache 2 authentication and authorisation module to block
						access to resources from normal	requests allowing access
						only to sub-requests from the specified module(s).

Homepage: 
   http://www.mad-hacking.net/

Building:
   Run:
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ make install

Configuration:
	Edit httpd.conf and add:
	
   	LoadModule authnz_subrequest_module modules/mod_authnz_subrequest.so

Simple usage:
   
	<LocationMatch "^.*\.xsl$">
	    AuthType SubRequest
	
	    SubRequestRejectMethod  404
	
	    Require sub-request mod_transform mod_include
	</LocationMatch>

Would block access to all xsl files (using 404 as the error code - effectively hiding
them) from anything but sub-requests generated by mod_transform or mod_include.  The
default reject method is 401.

Currently supported sub-requests include:

	ANY					(this will allow any sub-request)
	mod_include
	mod_transform

Additional sub-request types may be declared:

	SubRequestDeclareType mod_donkey donkey_derby

Where "mod_donkey" is the name of the module and "donkey_derby" is the internal module
name (which you will probably have to find from the desired module's source).
